| Decimal arithmetic icluding vertically aligned decimal places using randomly numbers.

Approach
----------

#. Decimals diagrams for subtraction and addition will be designed in LaTeX.
#. The LaTeX file will be broken into parts and placeholder text wil be inserted.
#. Python will replace the placeholder text in the backtracking LaTeX, allowing random numbers to be used.
#. Python will be used to generate a worksheet with diagrams that are all randomly generated.
#. Both a question sheet and an answer sheet will be built in LaTeX and then converted to a pdf of each.
#. Then a booklet will be made with answers as well.
