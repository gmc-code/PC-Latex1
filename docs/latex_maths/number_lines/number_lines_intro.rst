Number Lines intro
====================================================

| Number lines can be made using LaTeX to show the addition and subtraction of integers in year 7 maths.

Example Number line diagram

   :margin: 0
   :padding: 0

   .. grid-item-card::

Approach
----------

#. Number line diagrams will be designed in LaTeX.
#. The LaTeX file will be broken into parts and placeholder text wil be inserted.
#. Python will replace the placeholder text in the diagram LaTeX, allowing random numbers to be used.
#. Python will be used to generate a worksheet with 8 diagrams that are all randomly generated.
#. Both a question sheet and an answer sheet will be built in LaTeX and then converted to a pdf and png of each.
#. Then a 2 page worksheet will be made with answers as well.
